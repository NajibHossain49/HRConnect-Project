# HRConnect

HRConnect is a robust Employee Management System designed to streamline employee and task management processes. Built using modern web technologies, HRConnect incorporates role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure secure and efficient handling of organizational operations.

## Features

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
HRConnect supports three primary roles, each with distinct permissions:

1. **Admin**:
   - Create user roles.
   - Add new roles.
   - Assign roles to employees (HR, Manager, Employee).

2. **HR (Human Resources)**:
   - **Create Employee Record**: Add new employees to the system.
   - **Read Employee Information**: View and search through employee profiles and records.

3. **Manager**:
   - **Assign Tasks**: Assign tasks to team members with deadlines and priorities.
   - **Read Employee Performance**: View available employees and their performance data.
   - **Update Task Status**: Change the status of tasks (e.g., "In Progress," "Completed").
   - **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the system.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: TypeScript, Next.js
- **Backend**: Nest.js
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Token) with Bearer Token for route protection
- **Database**: Database used PostgreSQL
- **Styling**:  Styling library Tailwind CSS & DaisyUI
